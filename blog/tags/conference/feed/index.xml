      <description>Speaking at Web Devcon</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've tinkered with the idea of giving a talk at a "real" (read: commercial) conference for some time already. In the meanwhile life happened and kept me from really acting on this thinking. One could also say, that I simply didn't give the topic enough priority.<br />
</p>
<p>But this doesn't mean I wouldn't act, if the chance lies at my doorstep. So, when <a href="FIXME">Markus St√§uble</a> recently asked me, if I would like to give a talk about <a href="http://www.web-devcon.de/Programm/Soziale-Netze-integrieren">integrating social networks</a> (into one's site/applications) at this years <a href="http://www.web-devcon.de/">web devcon</a>, I happily said yes.<br />
</p>
<p>If you're at the conference, of course you have to come see my talk. If you're in Hamburg on the 17th or 18th October, and have time for a meetup, just <a href="/about.html">give me a shout</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The talk went pretty well, and the slides can be found <a href="/speaking/soziale-netze-integrieren/">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Next Steps for the German Software Craftsmanship Community</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:right; margin:20px 0 15px 15px;">
<img src="http://socrates2011.pbworks.com/f/SoCraTesWappen.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Logo of 'SoCraTes'' conference" title=""SoCraTes Logo""/>
</div>

<p>I spent the last one-and-a-half days at the <a href="http://socrates2011.pbworks.com/">SoCraTes</a> conference. I'm still kind of stoked about all the great people I met and were able to talk. It's such a great feeling to be part of such a clever and diverse community. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch">Nicole</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/leiderleider">Andreas</a> and all the others to make this event happen.</p>
<h3 id="fishbowl_discussion_at_socrates">Fishbowl Discussion at SoCraTes</h3>
<p>I'll certainly talk/blog more about SoCraTes and Software Craftsmanship in general on this blog in the next weeks and months. But for now, I want to summarize the outcome (if you can say, there was one) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)">Fishbowl discussion</a>, that was taking place on Friday evening, the conference's first day.</p>
<p>The discussion started with <a href="https://twitter.com/leiderleider">Andreas</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/ade_oshineye">Ade</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/urilavi">Uri</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mgaertne">Markus</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro</a>. For the uninitiated, I might add, that Sandro and Uri both started very successful Software Craftsmanship communities in their respective cities.</p>
<h3 id="next_steps">Next Steps</h3>
<p>The first question was (paraphrased) "what are the next concrete steps, to get the Software Craftsmanship community in germany off the ground". And although the question was not answered in a definitive way by anyone throughout the whole discussion, there were a lot of possible steps, tips &amp; tricks shared, that I want to note down as a reference. Note that I might paraphrase one or the other in order to better convey the point (or at least the point that I understood):</p>
<ol>
<li><em>"Find people who are committed to run the groups"</em><br />
This is kind of obvious to most, but still the first and most important point there is to actually starting the communities. Period.</li>
<li><em>"Focus on small geographical areas"</em><br />
We do not and should not aim to build geographical disperse communities/groups. So this is almost abvious. Go for the people in your vicinity, in your city. This does not mean, that you cannot cooperate with groups in other cities, like visiting "partner-groups" regularly or organizing joint-events every now and then.</li>
<li><em>"Define what's not included"</em><br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/ade_oshineye">Ade</a> brought this one up, which generally falls under the category of "expectation management". But putting it in these exact words is so much more tangible and to the point.</li>
<li><em>"Talk about basic principles and skills first (in the meetings)"</em><br />
This was <a href="https://twitter.com/urilavi">Uri</a>'s suggestion. I think this is meant to fulfill the "Raising the bar" tagline of the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto quickly and demonstrate to attendee's of community meetings, that it's not about talk &amp; discussion only.</li>
<li><em>"Promote to people outside the normal groups"</em><br />
I can't remember anymore who said it, but it sure is a way to make sure, that a Software Craftsmanship community/group is not just like any other tech-specific group. Software Craftsmanship groups should aim to encompass a broader goal. It's not about technology <em>xyz</em>, but about pushing boundaries, getting better at what we do.</li>
<li><em>"Work with other local communities // cross-promote events"</em><br />
Which boils down to: Be a good &amp; respectful "citizen". Don't try to "steal" members, but rather work together to foster great communities, not just one great community.</li>
<li><em>"Put limits on how many people are coming"</em>
This is not a next step or tip per se. It was meant as advice for a later stage, when meetings <em>may</em> get out of hand (with regards to size &amp; scope) and is meant to be used in conjunction with point 3. above.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what_i_think_are_next_steps">What I think are next steps:</h3>
<p>It was decided during the Fishbowl on Friday evening, that a session would be held during the conference's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space</a> on saturday, in which concrete next steps on how to start/launch the Software Craftsmanship community in germany would be decided.<br />
</p>
<p>However, I was not able to attend the conference's second day. So I decided to contribute to this Open Space session from afar and put forth the next actions, that are necessary and sensible from my point of view:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a mailinglist for group organizers</strong>, to allow for event coordination and exchange of ideas, tips, tricks &amp; motivation. Everybody who joins this mailinglist declares to organize a new or support an existing Software Craftsmanship group in his/her german city.</li>
<li><strong>Have at least 2-3 Software Craftsmanship groups across germany</strong> by December 2011.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/sshishkin">Sergey</a> proposed that the <a href="http://blog.coderetreat.com/global-day-of-coderetreat">Global Day of CodeRetreat</a> would be a good setting for promoting the forming of Software Craftsmanship groups. (this also aligns perfectly with my plan to organize a <a href="http://www.coderetreat-rhein-main.com/">CodeRetreat in Frankfurt or Rhein-Main area</a>, so I might be biased)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's already it. From there on, the local group initiators/organizers will have to organize and promote their groups. And this of course will depend on the local circumstances. But the mailing-list can serve as a back-up for all group leaders to work together and support each other.</p>
